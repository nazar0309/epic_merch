## Responsiveness Testing

The deployed website underwent extensive testing across a spectrum of devices and screen sizes to guarantee its responsiveness and adaptability. Developer Tools were instrumental in simulating diverse screen dimensions, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the website's behavior on various devices.
A combination of Bootstrap classes, custom CSS, and template syntax played a pivotal role in crafting the desired design. This strategic implementation not only ensured visual consistency but also maintained functional integrity across different platforms. By leveraging these tools and techniques, the website is poised to deliver an optimized user experience, regardless of the device being used.

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

#### Confirmation Email Not Sent to Users After Checkout

* After a successful purchase, some authenticated users did not receive a confirmation email, whereas guest users received it correctly. The issue was caused by incorrect handling of the email field in the checkout function. The issue was fixed by ensuring that the email is properly fetched and used in the send_mail function.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

    ```python
    # checkout/views.py
    user_email = order.email
    send_mail(
        subject, message, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, [user_email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )

```

</details>

#### Superusers Unable to Add Products

* Superusers attempting to add products encountered validation errors despite filling out the form correctly. The issue was due to missing error handling in the add_product function when processing form files. The issue was resolved by improving error messages and ensuring that file handling was properly included in form validation.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

    ```python

    # products/views.py
    form = ProductForm(request.POST, request.FILES)  # Ensure file uploads are processed
    if form.is_valid():
        product = form.save()
        messages.success(request, 'Successfully added product!')

```

</details>

#### Duplicate Newsletter Subscriptions

* Users were able to subscribe multiple times to the newsletter despite the email field being unique. The issue was caused by duplicate models handling newsletter subscriptions (NewsletterSubscriber and Subscriber). The issue was resolved by consolidating the models and enforcing validation at the form level.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

```python

        # models.py
    class Subscriber(models.Model):
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)  # Enforce uniqueness
        subscribed_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

```

</details>

#### JavaScript Payment Form Validation Errors

* When filling out the payment form, users encountered JavaScript errors related to the card.addEventListener function. The issue was caused by an incorrect reference to the card-errors element. The issue was fixed by ensuring the correct selection of the error message container.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

```javascript

// checkout/static/js/stripe_elements.js
var errorDiv = document.getElementById('card-errors');
if (event.error) {
    var html = `
        <span class="icon" role="alert">
            <i class="fas fa-times"></i>
        </span>
        <span>${event.error.message}</span>
    `;
    $(errorDiv).html(html); // Ensure correct reference
}

```

</details>

#### Deployment Issues

* The project failed to deploy due to missing environment variables for Stripe payment integration. The issue was fixed by ensuring that all required environment variables were set in the hosting platform.

<details>
<summary> Stripe keys error
</summary>

# .env
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
</details>

#### **HTML Validation Errors**
When testing HTML code, some validation errors were displayed:

- `<div>` elements containing incorrect `aria-*` attributes (resolved by replacing with valid attributes).
- `<div>` elements containing `href` attributes (resolved by replacing with `data-bs-target`).
- `<div>` elements containing `tabindex` attributes (resolved by removing the attribute).
- `<input>` elements containing `unchecked` attributes (resolved by removing the attribute).
- Incorrect heading order (fixed by following a descending heading order).
- Warnings for `<script>` tags with unnecessary `type="text/javascript"` attributes (fixed by removing the attribute).
- `<ul>` elements containing `aria-labelledby` attributes not linked to describing elements (replaced with `title` attributes).
- `<div>` elements containing `aria-label` attributes (fixed by replacing with `title` attributes).
- `<a>` elements nested in `<li>` elements containing `aria-label` attributes (fixed by replacing with `title` attributes).
- `<input>` elements described by `aria-describedby` attributes (fixed by replacing with `title` attributes).

        if request.user.is_authenticated:
            wishlist, created = Wishlist.objects.get_or_create(user=request.user)
            wishlist_items = request.user.wishlist.items.all()

         In the `checkout/views.py`, the following code had a missing implementation to properly process the order. The updated solution is as follows.
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary> Solution
    </summary>

    ```python

    if order_form.is_valid():
        order = order_form.save(commit=False)
        pid = request.POST.get('client_secret').split('_secret')[0]
        # order.stipe_pid = pid
        order.stripe_pid = pid
        order.original_bag = json.dumps(bag)
        order.save()
        for item_id, quantity in bag.items():
    ```

    </details>

#### Javascript Validation Erros

* missing `;`, fixed by adding missing elements
* blankspaces, fixed by deleting them
