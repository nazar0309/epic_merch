### Color Scheme

- The predominant color is **White** `#fff`, providing clarity and contrast for text, icons, and UI elements. It is used extensively in the text, button hover effects, and to create visual separation in UI components like the navbar and footer.

- **Dark Gray** `#383838` serves as the main background color for major layout components such as the navbar, footer, and card containers. It provides a sleek and professional appearance while ensuring that text stands out clearly.

- **Neon Green** `#00FF33` adds a dynamic touch to interactive elements, such as search buttons, input fields on focus, and hover effects. This vibrant color draws attention to actions the user can take, like submitting forms or interacting with dropdown menus.

- **Light Gray** `#A0A0A0` is used for hover effects, primarily in links and navbar elements. It creates a subtle transition effect, guiding the userâ€™s attention as they interact with the page.

- **Black with Opacity** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` and `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` are used for background overlays on specific sections (like product images and detail containers). These translucent shades add depth and allow the content to stand out without losing the background context.

- **Soft White** `#e0e0e0` is used as a border color for table row separations, creating a subtle yet effective distinction between table data and enhancing readability.

### Product Images

- Various high-quality images of delectable foods are strategically placed to evoke the essence of culinary delight. These images contribute to an immersive and engaging visual experience. All product images were sourced from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

### Typography

- **Libre Baskerville**: Libre Baskerville is a serif font with a stylish and sophisticated feel. It adds a touch of elegance to headings and subheadings, making it suitable for conveying a sense of formality and structure in your design.
